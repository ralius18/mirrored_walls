      <h3>Castles</h3>
      <p>
        I walk alone here through pouring rain<br>
        This feeling inside tells me that something's changed<br>
        <br>
        Cos from the day that I heard your name<br>
        I knew my life just would not be the same<br>
        Now every time that I close my eyes<br>
        Your smile stares right back at me and I'm alright<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes when I fall asleep at night<br>
        I'm just waiting for my phone's green light<br>
        And sound that tells me that you're still around<br>
        <br>
        Cos from the day that I heard your name<br>
        I knew my life just would not be the same<br>
        Now every time that I close my eyes<br>
        Your smile stares right back at me and I'm alright<br>
        <br>
        Because when shadows take my sight you make my world seem so bright<br>
        Bring my world back to life, bring my world back to life<br>
        Because when shadows take my sight you make my world seem so bright<br>
        Bring my world back to life, bring my world back to life<br>
        And in theses darkened halls you helped me find the light<br>
        You brought me back to life<br>
        <br>
        But the dogs they came to find you<br>
        Dragged you back into the dark<br>
        Glass castle walls you've built alone crash down around your heart<br>
        So I'll speak to you in silence (Keep me safe inside)<br>
        Draw you back into our castle and keep you safe inside<br>
        <br>
        Cos from the day that I heard your name<br>
        I knew my life just would not be the same<br>
        Now every time that I close my eyes<br>
        Your smile stares right back at me and I'm alright<br>
        Draw you back into our castle<br>
        Keep me safe inside<br>

        I can't find ground, I'm upside down<br>
        A hurricane of harrowed thoughts spin me around<br>
        <br>
        How could I have been wrong<br>
        To not let you sing along<br>
        I'm lost in my head<br>
        Stuck in this same place again<br>
        <br>
        My eyes bright red, rolling back into my head<br>
        I'm coming undone, and I could use someone<br>
        <br>
        How could I have been wrong<br>
        To not let you sing along<br>
        I'm lost in my head<br>
        Stuck in this same place again<br>
        <br>
        When gravity collapses beneath my feet<br>
        You're the only one, the only one I need<br>
        When gravity collapses beneath my feet<br>
        You're the only one who can help me<br>
        <br>
        How could I have been wrong<br>
        To not let you sing along<br>

        Stuck in this same place again<br>

        I hope you're well and I wish you all the best<br>

        I just hope you're happy with the choice you made<br>
        To walk away that night to sleep with him instead of me<br>
        Fuck<br>
        <br>
        It's fine that you're a liar, now I get that that's your thing<br>
        But it makes me question everything you told me honestly<br>
        Sometimes I wonder if I loved you at all<br>
        Or if all I loved was a character that you invented<br>
        <br>
        What does it mean when I still want you?<br>
        (What does it mean when I still want you?)<br>
        You screwed me over, ran away but somehow I still need you<br>
        I never wanna see your face again but for some reason<br>
        You're still upon the inside of my eyelids<br>
        <br>
        The diamonds grown dull and the flowers wilted<br>
        I gave away the lights and your song has faded into<br>
        Memory is all that's left of you because I<br>
        Made it a rule to break and burn everything left behind<br>
        <br>
        Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        <br>
        What does it mean when I still want you?<br>

        You're tidal, eternal<br>
        Your ebb and flow the strongest hold<br>
        Never thought that my faith would wane<br>
        But I never thought I'd be on my own<br>
        You abandoned me here, You left me on my own<br>
        <br>
        I will not bow and scrape, bend my knee for your sake<br>
        Breaking I've lost all my faith in all that you are<br>
        Wandering streets in the night, begging with headlights<br>
        To take me away from this place of remorse and disgust, with what I've become<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm liberated from your arms<br>
        Overwhelmed by the emptiness<br>
        My world has faded and starved while I was your puppet<br>
        You abandoned me here, Were you ever sincere, Tell me<br>

        I will not bow and scrape, bend my knee for your sake<br>
        Breaking I've lost all my faith in all that you are<br>

        To take me away from this place of remorse and disgust, with what I've become<br>
        <br>
        Couldn't see your dark side, all that you tried to hide<br>
        Tangled within your net, manipulated<br>
        Now I've seen your dark side, all that you tried to hide<br>
        Free from within your net, I'm the catch you should have kept<br>
        <br>
        I will not bow and scrape, bend my knee for your sake<br>
        Breaking I've lost all my faith in all that you are<br>

        Your sleeves, sewn to your palms, yo hide the journey on your arms<br>
        But I'll have you know, you're perfect in every way to me<br>
        You're not, just a fleeting thought, that sometimes passes through<br>
        The day that we met we set this firm<br>
        My mind's a mansion where you dwell and<br>
        <br>
        If your blood boils black<br>

        I'll take the scars within your chest<br>
        And kiss every one<br>
        Can't claim to heal but know that you are not alone<br>
        Stand back<br>
        Watch this bloom<br>
        Just give this a chance<br>
        A home that's built to last<br>

        I know I left you stranded, when you needed me most<br>
        I know I felt abandoned, cos I was living with a ghost<br>
        <br>
        I had no choice, I knew you weren't happy<br>
        I had no choice, I had no choice<br>

        In open water I'm drifting out to sea<br>
        The water fills my lungs, now it has taken me<br>
        Light fades away as I fall deeper, the current drags me back to shore<br>
        My life forgotten, once broken and ignored<br>
        <br>
        How'd you feel that it's it's fine, to push me away and still be mine<br>
        You knew we were both unhappy, but you still thought we'd marry<br>
        I knew I had to get out, so you could have no more doubts<br>
        Don't say I gave no warning, You'd never fucking listen<br>

        Ribs retaining pounding sentiments<br>
        Holding back the truth<br>
        <br>
        I wish I didn't care about you and complicate things so<br>
        I'm hurting you by hurting me, but somehow I can't let go<br>
        Didn't mean to be so awkward, was never my intent<br>
        I'm hurting you by hurting me<br>
        <br>
        In your presence I'm paralysed<br>
        But perfectly at peace<br>
        A decade's passed and then some<br>
        The long night has begun<br>
        <br>
        Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Can only hide for so long<br>

        Way past caring if I'm the only one in your life<br>
        But I'm a shit friend cos I tell you to dump his lying ass<br>
        Cos that would be a conflict, is it my agenda?<br>
        To state all that's in my mind would be duplicitous<br>
        Don't want to be insidious, just want to keep you whole<br>
        But some things you've got to learn in your own time<br>
        When it tumbles down<br>
        I hope you know, I will pick up the shards, because<br>
        I've got your back, I'm on your side<br>
        I will defend, Your every perfect angle<br>
        <br>
        Don't want to be an inconvenience<br>
        But this keeps breaking through<br>
        Bound with marigolds and violets<br>
        Lay this heart in deeper tombs<br>
        Till I see your face again, cos...<br>
        <br>
        Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Can only hide for so long<br>

        You can't help what's dead so just bury me<br>
        Alone in my head<br>

        There's wings on my back made of feather and wax<br>
        As I look to the sky, I can't help but ask why<br>

        But I still think there's hope for me out there<br>
        Somewhere out there<br>

        A shadow hand reaches out to touch me<br>

        Before I know, this hand has taken hold<br>

        I'm on my knees, this darkness smothers me<br>
        I'm choking every time I breathe<br>

        If I open up my eyes<br>
        Will I see the sun shine<br>

        It's indecorous to return to your bed, when I know before I'm gone<br>
        You're filled with regret<br>
        But how can I leave my side made, when all I want's to keep you safe<br>
        And you don't do well alone<br>

        Where do you go when you retreat inside your head?<br>
        I do not know how to reach beyond your ivory walls<br>
        <br>
        There's no point to a lifeline that you won't take (But I'll throw it anyway)<br>
        I have frayed and faded waiting for your hand<br>
        But I'd tread seas and traverse oceans all my years (All your years) for just a day<br>
        <br>
        Where do you go when you retreat inside your head? (Where do you go?)<br>
        I do not know how to reach beyond your ivory walls<br>
        And lift you up and pull you out and show you I'm always on your side<br>
        Where do you go? Where do you go?<br>
        <br>
        And I'd wage war on the demons within your mine<br>
        Burn down thorns and thickets wild around your heart (Anything to help it beat again)<br>
        I'd do it all a thousand time for just a smile<br>
        <br>
        Where do you go when you retreat inside your head? (Inside my head)<br>
        I do not know how to reach beyond your ivory walls<br>

        I'm up for 36 and I'm down for 12<br>
        In a red eyed haze but know I'm not blazed<br>
        I'm high on drifting by, barely touching down on life<br>
        Is a new dawn still another day if I haven't slept in 38<br>
        Wish I could empty my mind and bid these failures goodbye<br>

        Tracing cracks of heartache on my skin<br>
        It's not the first time that I've felt this strange<br>
        But I thought that it would fade away with age<br>
        Seems it's here to stay<br>
        Got me searching desperately for a change<br>
        <br>
        If I could do it all again, live life from start to end with no regrets<br>

        It's time I lose control, and let the walls break down<br>
        I'm sick of this fight, battling through life<br>
        Don't want to do it anymore<br>
        Because you're gone, there's no one left to calm the storm<br>
        Behind the stone facade<br>
        There's no peace, no still place<br>
        I've got to let the tempest rage, and lose control<br>
        <br>
